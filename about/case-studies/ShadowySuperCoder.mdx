## Shadowy Super Coder[](#shadowy-super-coder "Direct link to heading")

**Challenge**Developers of the Web3 ecosystem are often overlooked and underappreciated. Galxe wanted to design and reward developers with a special Shadowy Super Coder NFT to all of those who contributed to our ecosystem. We then thought of a way to also help the developers by recreating something similar to the GitHub education pack.

**Solution**Back in August 2021, Galxe along with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/), [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/), [Parsiq](https://www.parsiq.net/), [Torus](https://toruswallet.io/), [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/), [Curvegrid](https://www.curvegrid.com/), and [OneKey](https://onekey.so/) launched the “Shadowy Super Coder” NFT Pack to over 100,000 eligible blockchain developers. The package includes a specially-designed Shadowy Coder NFT, and various exclusive perks worth $300 million USD.

**Results**

The Shadowy Super Coder Campaign helped our partners acquire new users while rewarding our builders. Truly a win-win.
