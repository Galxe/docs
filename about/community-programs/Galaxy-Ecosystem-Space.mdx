We want to connect more with our community and present new avenues for them among the galxe ecosystem.

So we created the Galxe Ecosystem Space in our discord. 

Galxe ecosystem space is a place for other communities including newer web 3 projects to reach out and connect with us directly through discord using campaign ideas and offers that utilize the galxe credential system. 

Community members with ideas and connections can also make proposals in ecosystem space after being vetted by the galxe team.

Head over to our discord and you will find the channel underneath the "Space" tab !

**Fair warning a post in this channel or offer to the community is not an endorsement by Galxe it is just a way for us to try and build out the ecosystem even further while providing more avenues for our members. Always make sure you are participating in campaigns and offers at your own discretion.**
