G DAO is managed by G holders. G holders have the ability manage funds held by the Galxe & Gravity Community Treasury. All proposals need to go through a three-step process described below. In order for a proposal to pass, it must have over 50% passing votes with endorsement from wallet addresses holding at least 120,000,000 G, with delegation allowed. When a proposal is passed, the changes will be implemented by Galxe’s operation team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Proposal">
    All proposals need to go through the following process:



    **Phase 1: Proposal Temperature Check - Forum**

    The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. To create a Temperature Check for your Proposal, follow the Proposal Template and post on the [DAO Governance category on G DAO Forum](https://dao-forum.galxe.com/c/governance/5).



    **Proposal Template**:

    * Abstract

    * Motivation

    * Specification

      * Overview

      * Scope

      * Success Criteria

      * Timeline/Budget

      * References

    The temperature check must be held for a period of at least 5 days. If feedback is sufficient, the proposal can move to Phase 2.



    **Phase 2: Vote — Snapshot**

    Once your proposal has passed the temperature check, you can work with the operation team to schedule a snapshot vote. [The snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/gal.eth) will last for 5 days. In order for a proposal to pass, the GP must have:

    * Over 50% passing votes


    * Endorsement from wallet addresses holding at least 120,000,000 G

    * If the proposal is asking for funds less than $50,000 or does not implement significant change to the token/contract, the quorum for the vote is 12,000,000 G

  </Step>

  <Step title="Implementation">
    When a proposal is passed, the changes will be implemented by Galxe’s operation team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Multi-signature Signers">
    The multi-signature wallet signers are selected and voted in by GAL holders after token generation event. They are also subject to change from future governance votes.
