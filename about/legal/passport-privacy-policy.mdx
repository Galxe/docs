Summary of Our Privacy Policy

Welcome to GALXE Passport, Your universal identity for Web3 adventures! We are committed to protecting your privacy and this document describes in detail our data practices, including the types of data we collect and how we use this data. This summary is a short description of our Privacy Policy.

Our core Privacy Principles:

1. Anonymous and Secure

Your identity information will be encrypted with your password. This data is never stored in plain text and will not be accessible by anyone (including GALXE Passport) without your explicit permission.

2. Owning Access Control

You are in total control of your data. You can choose to share it with third parties or revoke it as you see fit.

3. Convenient

You only have to verify once to use your GALXE Passport across Web3 applications. You can use it for compliance processes or to simply prove yourself as a verified individual.

Information We Collect

We collect data require to verify your identity, which includes the following:

- Full name;
- Email address;
- Identity Verification Information, such as a picture of your Driver's License, State ID, or
- Passport;
- Picture of your face; and
- IP Address.

How We Use Your Information

The primary purpose for this data is to verify your identity. We work with a third party service provider, Sumsub, to verify your identity. You will upload your information, including identity verification Information, to Sumsub, who will then conduct the identity verification. Once your identity is verified, Sumsub will send to us a copy of the information you provided to verify your identity. We will pack the identity information into a verifiable credential, send it to you, and ask you to encrypt it with your password. After you send us the encrypted data, we will keep it safely stored on our servers, and delete all information we collected during the process. At this point, only you can use your password to decrypt and access your identity information. You may also decide that you want to share this information with another application. Instead of you taking pictures of your documents and uploading your information separately to a third party of your choosing, you can request the encrypted PII from GALXE, decrypt them locally with your password to get the PII in a verifiable credential format, and send it to the third party you trust.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How will my identity information be stored?

A: Your identity information will be encrypted with your password. GALXE Passport never stores identity information in plain text and will not have access to identity information.

Q: Who can access my identity information?

A: Because GALXE Passport does not store your password, only you can decrypt this data with your password. No one, including GALXE Passport, has access to your identity information without your permission.

Q: How can I use my GALXE Passport?

A: Partners (eg. IDO or INO platforms) who integrate GALXE ID SDK may ask for your identity information for compliance reasons. By granting them access to your GALXE Passport's identity information, you do not need to complete the verification process on their sites for additional times. Other partners may use GALXE Passport SBT as a proof-of-human mechanism to prevent sybil attack.

Q: If I participate in a campaign on GALXE which requires GALXE Passport credential, am I giving away my identity information?

A: No. GALXE Passport credential only looks at your GALXE Passport NFT holding in your wallet. GALXE Passport NFT is minted on BNB Chain with this contract address. Participating in these campaigns will not disclose your identity information.

Q: What happens if I lose my GALXE Passport password?

A: Because GALXE Passport does NOT store your password, there is no way to recover your password if you lose it. If you lose your password, you can still use your GALXE Passport as a proof-of-human NFT, however, you won't be able to decrypt your Sumsub data to share with other third parties for compliance purposes.

Q: What's Sumsub's role in the process?

A: Sumsub is the third party vendor that helps run algorithms and check whether your ID is valid. They collect the identity information directly from you because they need to provide the identity verification. Please note that your use of Sumsub's service is subject to Sumsub's Privacy Policy, which can be found here: https://sumsub.com/privacy-notice-service/ Sumsub then shares this information with GALXE Passport. However, they do not know which identity belongs to which address.

Q: Will I remain anonymous after I mint GALXE Passport?

A: Our third party identity verification vendor, Sumsub, only verifies your identity based on the documents and pictures you provide. Neither Sumsub, nor any other third party, has the capability to connect a user's verification documents to any particular wallet address. Therefore, verifying your information will not allow those third parties to tie any specific wallet address to any identifiable individual and you will remain anonymous. Likewise, minting a GALXE Passport token does not reveal your identity on the chain。

Q: Am I required to mint GALXE Passport in order to use GALXE?

A: No. None of the features on GALXE will require you to mint GALXE Passport. GALXE also does not require any of its partners to use GALXE Passport credential in their campaign. GALXE Passport credential is just like any other credential in the network. Campaign creators can choose to include or not include GALXE Passport credential as a requirement in their campaigns.

Q: What happens if any government agencies request users' information from GALXE Passport?

A: All user data is encrypted with your password. Therefore, we do not have access to and cannot view or share your information without your permission and password. Without your permission GALXE Passport does not have the password to decrypt the encrypted identity information.
