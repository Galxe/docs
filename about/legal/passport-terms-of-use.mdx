The Effective Date of the most up to date Terms will be provided at the top of each version of these Terms, respectively. Any such updates will be effective upon our publishing such updated Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Services.

Service Users. By using our Services you are a service user (“Service User"). By becoming a Service User, you agree: (a) to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself; (b) to maintain and promptly update from time to time. As necessary your information; (c) to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services; and (d) that you are fully responsible for all activity on the Services that occurs under your email and password combination. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to become a Service User, or limit the number of User Accounts or GALXE Passport NFT (as defined below) that you may associate with the Services, or suspend or terminate any Service User or User Account,including access to our Services.

You also agree that you will not:

- Use the Services if we've disabled access for you, unless you have our written permission first;
- Buy, sell, rent or lease access to your GALXE Passport NFT (as defined below) to any third party; or
- Use or access the Services through any unauthorized third party application(s) or client(s).

User Accounts. In order to create a GALXE Passport NFT, Service Users may need to create a User Account and provide Identity Documents (as defined below). To create a user account ("User Account”) with GALXE, you need to connect your digital wallet to the Services. Once you create a User Account, you will then need to verify your identity by providing certain information and uploading a picture of themselves and a picture of their passport, driver's license, national insurance card, or other government-issued identification (collectively, “Identity Documents”). Once your identity has been verified, you will be able to mint the GALXE Passport NFT.

These communications may include notices about your use of the Services (e.g., email changes and/or other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us.

Account Verification and Additional Information. GALXE may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering (or so-called “legalization”) of incomes obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting the financing of terrorism. GALXE may also require you to provide additional information and/or documents in cases where it has reason to believe that:

- Your use of the Services is related to money laundering or any other illegal or illicit activity;
- You have concealed or reported false identification information and/or other details; or
- Transactions effected via your User Account were effected in breach of these Terms.

In such cases, GALXE, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel your access to any or all Services until such additional information and/or documents are reviewed by us and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, GALXE, in its sole discretion, may refuse to provide the Services to you. Unless otherwise noted in writing, by submitting personal data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

3. GALXE Passport NFT

As part of the Services, you are able to create a verified identity token (“GALXE Passport NFT”). You may be required to provide us additional information to create your Token, required to confirm your identity. We work with a third party service provider, Sumsub, to verify your identity. You will upload your information, including identity verification information, to Sumsub, who will then conduct the identity verification. Once your identity is verified, Sumsub will send to us a copy of the information you provided to verify your identity. We will pack the identity information into a verifiable credential, send it to you, and ask you to encrypt it with your password. After you send us the encrypted data, we will keep it safely stored on our servers, and delete all information we collected during the process. At this point, only you can use your password to decrypt and access your identity information.

- A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of Digital Asset(s).

12. Dispute Resolution

This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. Informal Process. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and GALXE, you will first contact GALXE in a writing that specifically references this section and which describes the dispute and your position in relation to it in sufficient details for the receiving company to engage in meaningful discussions about the dispute (“Dispute Notice"). For a period of no less than thirty days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing, You shall make a good faith and sustained effort for a to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution.

Agreement to Arbitrate. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or GALXE's services and/or products, including but not limited to the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and GALXE or any other user of the Services, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination (collectively, “Dispute”), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration before a sole arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. You and GALXE shall endeavor to agree upon the arbitrator, and if you and GALXE fail to do so within twenty-one (21) days of the commencement of the Arbitration, the appointment shall be made by SIAC in accordance with the SIAC Rules. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies to you and to GALXE. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Dispute initiated by GALXE for infringement of its intellectual property, or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. The seat, or legal place of arbitration, shall be [Singapore], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: Support@galxe.com

Arbitration Procedure and Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the SIAC under the SIAC Rulesby a sole arbitrator. You can access the SIAC Rules at https://siac.org.sg/our-rules. Each party shall bear its own filing and administrative fees in the first instance. GALXE will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the "Class Action Waiver” section below.

Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff or similar proceeding (“Class Action").

The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case or to be a party to a class or representative action is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

Waiver of Jury Trial. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and GALXE each waive any right to a jury trial.

13. Miscellaneous

Governing Law and Venue. These Terms, your access to and use of the Services and Content, and your participation in the Services, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Singapore.

Severability. If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

Waiver. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

Assignability. These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with GALXE's express written consent.
