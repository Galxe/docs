For users in the UK and European Economic Area ("EEA"). We may sometimes transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the UK and EEA, for example if we are using a supplier based elsewhere. The privacy laws in countries outside the UK and EEA may be different from those in your home country.

Where we transfer data to a country that has not been deemed to provide adequate data protection standards, we will always have security measures and approved European or UK model clauses (available on the European Union's legal website at eur-lex.europa.eu and the UK ones at the ICO website www.ico.gov.uk) or other adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information.

When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of the Services and connected to the website of the organization or company that maintains that website. Even if an affiliation exists between us and a third-party website, we exercise no control over linked websites. Each of these linked websites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect, use, share, and secure your information before providing any Personal Information.
