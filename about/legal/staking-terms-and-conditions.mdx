By directly or indirectly accessing or using the Website and/or Services (each, as defined below), including, but not limited to, indirectly linking your Digital Wallet (defined below) to the Services or otherwise using the Website or Services or any portion thereof, you hereby consent to be bound by these terms and conditions (“Terms”). These Terms are entered into, and create a legally binding agreement, by and between you, and any organization you are acting on behalf of (“you” or “your”) and Star Frameworks Labs Pte Ltd., d/b/a Galxe, a Singapore company (“Galxe”, “we,” “our,” or “us”). We may amend or modify these Terms at any time and for any reason. The amended or modified Terms are effective immediately upon us posting them or otherwise making them available on [URL] (“Website”) and by continuing to link your Digital Wallet to our Services, or otherwise use our Services, you agree to such amended or modified Terms. You agree to be responsible for reviewing the Terms and any amendments or modifications thereto. If you do not agree with the Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease your use of the Services and/or Website.

THESE TERMS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, BOTH OF WHICH IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS AS TO HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.

1. Definitions. The definitions for certain defined terms used in these Terms are set out below. Other terms are defined elsewhere in these Terms.

1.1 “Digital Assets” means any digital blockchain asset subject to the Services, including the G token.

1.2 “Digital Wallet” means the wallet or similar device or software used to store Digital Assets.

1.3 “Net Reward” means the sum of the Rewards minus any Protocol Fees (if any).

1.4 “Rewards” means any rewards granted by the Supported Staking Protocol, including staking rewards, block rewards, and transaction fees, in each case as actually granted by such Supported Staking Protocol, as applicable.

1.5 “Protocol Fees” means any fees charged by the Supported Staking Protocol.

1.6 “Supported Asset” means a Digital Asset for which you can use to participate in staking services via the Services.

1.7 “Supported Staking Protocol” means the G token protocol or other staking, delegation or other validator node or staking smart contract that is made available via the Services from time to time.

2. Services

2.1 The Services. Subject to these Terms, we provide a front-end user interface to allow users to connect to the Supported Staking Protocol for Supported Assets (the “Services”). The Services are strictly offered on a non-custodial basis. You hereby agree and acknowledge that (a) Galxe does not at any time hold or custody any assets on your behalf, and (b) Galxe solely offers a front-end user interface for you to interact with third party Supported Staking Protocols, none of which are controlled by Galxe.

2.2 License to Access the Services. Subject to these Terms, we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to access and use the Services for purposes of staking Supported Assets to the Supported Staking Protocol accessible via our Services.

2.3 Blockchain Events. You acknowledge and agree that the Supported Staking Protocols are independently and separately operated and controlled by third parties. As such, at any time and for any reason, the Supported Staking Protocol may modify its protocol, stake or unstake, bond or unbond your Digital Assets, fork, or implement any other action or change that may impact your Net Rewards, Supported Assets, the Services and/or your access to and use of each of the foregoing (together, a “Blockchain Event”).

2.4 Protocol Lockups and Unstaking. Some Supported Staking Protocols require that your Digital Assets be locked (restricted from sale or transfer) for a period of time while staking or unstaking, such as 7 days for the G protocol. You will need to request for your staked Digital Assets to be unstaked before they can be sold or transferred. Depending on the underlying protocol, you may or may not receive staking rewards during the unstaking process. Expected unstaking periods are estimates only. We will notify you when the unstaking process is complete.

2.4 Changes to the Services. We reserve the right to modify, alter or otherwise change the Services from time to time by adding, deleting, or otherwise modifying features or functionality to improve your experience, comply with applicable regulations and/or laws or for any other reason or purpose. We further reserve the right to (i) discontinue any feature of the Services or any portion thereof at any time, including, without limitation, discontinue supporting any Supported Asset, or Supported Staking Protocol, or (ii) remove any content from the Services at any time, in each case for any reason in our sole discretion and without notice to you. You specifically acknowledge and agree that we are not (a) responsible for such modifications, changes, content removals, or (b) liable for any loss of value of your Digital Assets or loss of Net Rewards that may result directly or indirectly from any such changes or any Blockchain Event.

3. Rewards; Fees

3.1 Rewards. Your use of the Services may result in a Net Reward that is issued by the Supported Staking Protocol and either (a) transferred to the Digital Wallet address where your Supported Assets originated or is otherwise used by you in connection with the Services (the “Originating Wallet”), or (b) eligible to be claimed by you using the Originating Wallet. You acknowledge that (i) such Net Rewards may be issued in the same denomination as the Supported Assets, (ii) any estimates or projections of Rewards or Net Rewards, as applicable, are not a guarantee, (iii) we will never ask for and you should never provide to us the private key for your Originating Wallet or any other wallet, (iv) we are not responsible for the loss of your private key or your inability to access (a) your Originating Wallet, or (b) any resulting Net Rewards that may be stored or claimable therein, and (v) you assume responsibility for ensuring the proper use of the correct and valid address of your Originating Wallet(s), and that your Originating Wallet supports and is otherwise compatible with the Supported Asset and Supported Staking Protocol. You specifically acknowledge and understand that your Net Rewards may be subject to a bonding/unbonding, locking/unlocking, claim or other delay period or mechanism by the Supported Staking Protocol that may render your Net Rewards and/or Supported Assets unavailable and/or subject to other restrictions imposed and controlled by the Supported Staking Protocol (collectively, “Protocol Restrictions”).

3.2 Fees. In consideration for granting you a limited license to access and use our Services, you hereby agree that we may charge a service fee.

4. Termination

4.1 Termination.  In the event that you breach these Terms or if we reasonably determine that action is necessary or advisable under applicable law, we may terminate or suspend your right to use or otherwise access the Services with or without notice to you.  Such termination or suspension shall be a non-exclusive remedy for your breach of these Terms and we reserve the right to pursue any and all additional remedies that may be available to us. We may also terminate or suspend the Services in whole or in part for whatever reason and at any time.

4.2 Effects of Termination. In the event of any termination or suspension pursuant to Section ‎4.1 or otherwise, the Services will immediately cease. Termination or suspension of the Services may require you or us to complete certain additional tasks that comprise part of the Services, including, but not limited to, your compliance with certain Protocol Restrictions.

10. MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Governing Law.  These Terms, your access to and use of the Services and Content, and your participation in the Services, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the Republic of Singapore, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in court located in the Republic of Singapore.

10.2 Severability. If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of these Terms and the application of that provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected thereby, and that provision will be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by applicable laws.

10.3 Waiver. No waiver of any right under these Terms will be of any effect or binding upon anyone unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the party so waiving such right. No delay or failure of any party in exercising any right hereunder and no partial or single exercise of any such right will be deemed of itself to constitute a waiver of such right or other rights hereunder.

10.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions hereof are solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to, and will not be construed to, confer a right or benefit on any other person.

10.5 Assignment. You shall not assign or transfer (whether by operation of law or otherwise) these Terms (or any rights or obligations hereunder) to a third party.

10.6 Force Majeure. No party will be held liable or responsible to any other party nor be deemed to have breached these Terms for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any provision hereunder when such failure or delay results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, which may include embargoes, acts of war (whether declared or not), insurrections, riots, civil commotions, acts of terrorism, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, pandemics, epidemics or acts of God (a “Force Majeure Event”). The affected party will notify the other parties of such Force Majeure Event as soon as reasonably practical and will make every reasonable effort to mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure Event.

10.7 External Sites and Third-Party Content. The Website may contain links to third-party websites or content (“External Sites”). Such External Sites are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us of the content on such External Sites. The content of such External Sites is developed and provided by others. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or any content located on such External Sites. We are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites and do not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such External Sites. You should take precautions when (i) interacting with such External Sites, or (ii) downloading files from all websites to protect your computer from viruses and other destructive programs. If you decide to access linked External Sites, you do so at your own risk.

10.8 Arbitration. This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully.

(i) Informal Process. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Galxe, you will first contact Galxe and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.

(ii) Agreement to Arbitrate. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

10.9 Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case or to be a party to a class or representative action is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

(i) Waiver of Jury Trial. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Galxe each waive any right to a jury trial.
