# 17. DMCA Notice and Procedure for Copyright Infringement Claims​

As Galxe asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. Galxe, in appropriate circumstances, may remove from the Services information that might infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

## 1) Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements​

If you believe your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on the Galxe Services, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Designated Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright's interest;
A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, including the URL (i.e., web page address) of the location where the copyrighted work exists or a copy of the copyrighted work;
Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Galxe Services where the material that you claim is infringing is located; your address, telephone number, and E-mail address;
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid and we will have no obligation to respond or acknowledge receipt of your notice. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you misrepresent or make bad faith claims that any material on the Galxe Services infringes your copyrights. You can contact our Designated Agent via e-mail at dmca@galxe.com.
THE DESIGNATED AGENT SHOULD BE CONTACTED ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR WORK HAS BEEN USED OR COPIED IN A WAY THAT CONSTITUTES COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND SUCH INFRINGEMENT IS OCCURRING ON THE GALXE SERVICES. ALL OTHER INQUIRIES DIRECTED TO THE DESIGNATED AGENT WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

## 2) Receipt of Proper Infringement Notification​

Once a proper bona fide infringement notification has been received by the Designated Agent, it is Galxe's policy:
To remove or disable access to the infringing content;
To notify the content provider, member, or user ("Content Provider") that it has removed or disabled access to the content; and
That repeat offenders will have the infringing content removed from the system and that Galxe may terminate such Content Provider's access to the Galxe Services.

## 3) Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent​

If the Content Provider believes that the content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing or the Content Provider believes that it has the right to post and use such content, the Content Provider may send the Designated Agent a counter-notice, which must contain the following:
Content Provider's contact information, including full legal name (not that of a company) of the submitter, an email address, a physical address, and a phone number.
The location, including any URL, of the content that has been removed or disabled.
The following statement, to which Content Provider must agree: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which Galxe is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant."
The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
A physical or electronic signature. To satisfy this requirement, Content Provider may type the submitter's full legal name (not that of a company) at the bottom of your electronic counter-notification.
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Galxe may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten business days.
If Galxe does not receive notice within ten business days that the original complaining party is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the content, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed. The decision to replace or cease disabling access to any content is at Galxe's sole discretion.

# 18. Indemnification​

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Galxe, and our respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, Creators, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (individually and collectively, the "Galxe Parties"), from and against all actual or alleged claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, "Claims"), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) your use or misuse of the Services, (b) any Feedback (as defined below) you provide, (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable laws, and/or (d) your violation of any right(s) of any third party.

# 24. Dispute Resolution​

This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully.
Informal Process. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Galxe, you will first contact Galxe and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.
Agreement to Arbitrate. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the BVI International Arbitration Centre (BVIIAC) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, as modified by the IAC Procedures for the Administration of Arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.*
The Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff or similar proceeding ("Class Action"). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case or to be a party to a class or representative action is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
Waiver of Jury Trial. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Galxe each waive any right to a jury trial.

# 25. Miscellaneous​

Governing Law and Venue. These Terms, your access to and use of the Services and Content, and your participation in the Services, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the British Virgin Islands, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Waver. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
Assignability. These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Galxe's express written consent.
Notices. All notices under these Terms will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.
