## 1.1\. Entities Diagram[](#11-entities-diagram "Direct link to heading")

![Diagram.png](/images/developer/graphql-api/1659682658861468090.png)

### 1.1.1\. Space[](#111-space "Direct link to heading")

Space is used for aggregating your campaigns.

### 1.1.2\. Campaign[](#112-campaign "Direct link to heading")

Campaign is the key object that holds all info for NFT claiming process. Except info of itself, like campaign name, thumbnail, description, it also contains info of NFT contract, NFT template etc.

### 1.1.3\. NFT Core[](#113-nft-core "Direct link to heading")

NFT contract(ERC-721) that used for minting NFTs within the campaign.

### 1.1.4\. NFT Template[](#114-nft-template "Direct link to heading")

NFT template of the campaign contains info that used for generating metadata of a minted NFT. Including NFT name, image, traits etc.

### 1.1.5\. Credential[](#115-credential "Direct link to heading")

Credential is elemental object that determine whether an address is eligible to claim the NFT. It takes a single wallet address as input and outputs 0(false)/1(true) to indicate whether the wallet address is eligible for this credentail.

### 1.1.6\. Formula(Deprecated)[](#116-formula(Deprecated) "Direct link to heading")

Formula is a algebraic expression of credentials and entries, the output of formula decide whether and how many NFTs a user can claim witin the campaign. e.g. (C\_2&C\_3)_1 means a user eligible for both credential 2 and 3 can claim one NFT, (C\_4|C\_5)_2 means a user eligible for either credential 4 and 5 can claim two NFTs.

### 1.1.7\. TaskConfig[](#117-taskConfig "Direct link to heading")

TaskConfig is the configuration structure of campaign's task condition and task reward. It replaces the previous structure of Formula and credgroup, but we will fill in the credgroup structure with data for compatibility. It is recommended to use this structure when there is TaskConfig.

detailed structure as follows:

```
# Both structures are first-level structures of camp
{
  "TaskConfig": {
    "participateCondition": ParticipateCondition -> A necessary condition for the campaign, which is optional. If this is present, it is a threshold condition for participating in the campaign. It must be completed to verify the following participation tasks.
      -> ParticipateCondition: {
        conditions: [ExprEntity]
          -> as ExprEntity below
        conditionalFormula: string -> as conditionalFormula below
        eligible: bool -> It means whether the entire ParticipateCondition is eligible
      }
    "referralConfig": RewardConfig -> The task and reward configuration of the campaign`s referral, which is optional. The detailed structure is RewardConfig.
      -> as RewardConfig below
    "rewardConfigs": []RewardConfig -> campaign`s task and reward configuration, the detailed structure is [] RewardConfig.
      -> RewardConfig: {
        conditions: [ExprEntity]
          -> ExprEntity: {
              cred: Cred -> cred info
              attrs: [ExprEntityAttr] -> This parameter is only available when encountering multi credential, such as space user, score, etc.
                -> ExprEntityAttr: { -> Ex: score >= 100
                  attrName: String! -> The name of the cred parameter
                  operatorSymbol: String! -> Conditional operator for parameters
                  targetValue: String! -> Conditional target value of parameter
                }
              attrFormula: String -> This is a combined expression that means conditions, usually simple ALL/ANY, but also supports complex expressions such as: (entity_0&&entity_1)||(entity_3&&entity_4)||(entity_5&&entity_6)
              eligible: Boolean -> It means whether the entire ExprEntity is eligible.
              eligibleAddress: [String]  -> This represents which addresses are eligible (usually means when multiple binding addresses are eligible)
            }
        conditionalFormula: string -> This is a combined expression that means conditions, usually simple ALL/ANY, but also supports complex expressions such as: (entity_0&&entity_1)||(entity_3&&entity_4)||(entity_5&&entity_6)
        eligible: bool -> It means rewardConfig is eligible.
        description: string
        rewards: [ExprReward]
          -> ExprReward: {
            arithmetics: [ExprEntity]
              -> as ExprEntity before, but the attrFormula here is a little different from the above. Here is an arithmetic expression. ex: entity_0+entity_1, entity_0/entity_1, entity_0/2
            arithmeticFormula: String -> This is a combined expression that represents the amount of the reward, usually a simple constant, but complex expressions are also supported, such as: (entity_0+entity_1)/2, entity_0/2*5
            rewardType: CredentialGroupRewardEntity -> NFT,TOKEN,DISCORDROLE,LOYALTYPOINTS,OAT,CUSTOM,LOYALTYPOINTSMYSTERYBOX,MINTLIST
            rewardCount: Int64 -> This is the reward quantity value calculated by using the user's actual data into the expression.
          }
        rewardAttrVals: RewardAttrVal -> Parameter replacement value of multi credential
      }
  }
}

# This structure is gradually deprecated. If there is TaskConfig, it is recommended to use the above data structure. If not, compatible data will be filled here.
{
  "CredentialGroup": {
    credentials: [Cred] -> credential detail strcut, There is an eligible field inside that represents the achievement status of each credential.
    conditionRelation: CredentialGroupConditionRelation  -> ALL/ANY
    conditions: [CredentialGroupCondition]
      -> CredentialGroupCondition: {
        eligible: Boolean -> It means whether the entire ExprEntity is eligible.
        eligibleAddress: [String]  -> This represents which addresses are eligible (usually means when multiple binding addresses are eligible)
      }
    rewards: [CredentialGroupReward]
      -> CredentialGroupReward: {
        rewardType: CredentialGroupRewardEntity -> NFT,TOKEN,DISCORDROLE,LOYALTYPOINTS,OAT,CUSTOM,LOYALTYPOINTSMYSTERYBOX,MINTLIST
        rewardCount: Int64 -> This is the reward quantity value calculated by using the user's actual data into the expression.  
      }
  }
}
```

## 1.2\. Integration workflow[](#12-integration-workflow "Direct link to heading")

1. Sign up for Galxe Space Dashboard, please visit [Create a Space](https://galxe.com/createspace).
2. Create credentials through the Dashboard. Upload data for your credentials if their source is CSV file.
3. Create NFT core(NFT contract) if needed, if you are only need to intergrate OAT campaign, then it`s not needed.
4. Create space through the Dashboard.
5. Create campaign with with “Integrate campaign claiming into third-party websites” checked under your space through the Dashboard. _(This will turn the campaign into gasless mode, right now we only support integrate gasless claim)_
6. Go to your campaign page inside Galxe to check if the campaign info is correct and credentials lighted up for eligible users.
7. Release your campaign through Dashboard.
8. Integrate `query campaign` API, get campaign info data for rendering your NFT claim page.
9. If you need to check whether a user is eligible to claim before hand, integrate `query campaign` API to get `TaskConfig(address: $address)`, If there is a `participateCondition` field, it is determined that `participateCondition->eligible == true`. If not, `rewardConfigs->eligible` it represents the achievement of each set of tasks, and `rewardConfigs->rewards->rewardCount` represents the number of rewards that the user can obtain.
10. Integrate `mutation prepareParticipate` API, send the claim request once user claim.
11. If needed, integrate `query participations` API to check Tx status periodically.
12. If you want, integrate `query campaign` API and get `holders(first:Int, after:String)` field info to setup NFTs showcase page.
13. If needed, integrate `query SpaceLeaderboard` API to get Leaderboard info (But if you need data after 1000 positions in the rankings, you need owner auth).

**NOTE:** Then you will need an access token bound to your galxe account to use this API. Please go to the Galxe user setting page to generate an access token.Then add `access-token` in the header of the query.

## 2.1\. Overview[](#21-overview "Direct link to heading")

For endpoint and other info, please refer to [Overview | Galxe Docs](/developer/graphql-api/overview).

## 2.2\. Query campaign[](#22-query-campaign "Direct link to heading")

This API is used for get campaign object, a campaign is the key object that holds all info for NFT claiming process, integrate this API to setup your own NFT claim page.
