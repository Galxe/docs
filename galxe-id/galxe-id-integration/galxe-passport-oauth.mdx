Galxe Passport does not allow the acquisition of KYC data for the time being, but you can determine whether the user has a Passport through the following methods.

## Contract Information

The Galxe Passport is an NFT contract deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that serves as proof of identity within the Galxe ecosystem.

- **Contract Address**: `0xe84050261cb0a35982ea0f6f3d9dff4b8ed3c012`

## Verification Methods

### Method 1: Using Galxe Credential

You can verify Passport ownership using the Galxe credential:

- **Credential Link**: [Galxe Passport V2 Holders](https://app.galxe.com/quest/credential/191835644327796737)

### Method 2: Direct Contract Call

Call the `balanceOf` method on the contract to check if a user owns a Passport.

**Method Signature**: `balanceOf(address user) returns (uint256)`

- Returns `1` if the user owns a Passport

## Using curl to Call balanceOf

```bash
# Set variables
RPC_URL="https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xe84050261cb0a35982ea0f6f3d9dff4b8ed3c012"
USER_ADDRESS="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"

# Method selector for balanceOf(address) = 0x70a08231
# Pad user address to 32 bytes (remove '0x' prefix and pad with zeros)
PADDED_ADDRESS=$(echo $USER_ADDRESS | sed 's/0x//' | xargs -I {} printf "%064s" {})
DATA="0x70a08231${PADDED_ADDRESS}"

# Call the contract
curl -X POST $RPC_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",
    \"method\": \"eth_call\",
    \"params\": [{
      \"to\": \"$CONTRACT_ADDRESS\",
      \"data\": \"$DATA\"
    }, \"latest\"],
    \"id\": 1
  }"
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
}
```

Convert the hexadecimal result to decimal:

- `0x0000...0001` = `1` (user has Passport)
- `0x0000...0000` = `0` (user does not have Passport)
