For all Loyalty Point contract deployed via our factory on Gravity chains, we provide the following GraphQL API to query the leaderboard:

- Endpoint: https://graphigo.prd.galaxy.eco/query
- Playground: https://graphigo.prd.galaxy.eco

## Example

Here is an example of how to query the API:

```graphql
query {
  loyaltyPointLeaderboard(
    loyaltyPointAddress: "0x6B08B2fC665F766193A0cB9a64bcfB8beaac03D4"
    limit: 10
  ) {
    totalCount
    list {
      address
      points
      rank
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "loyaltyPointLeaderboard": {
      "totalCount": 1,
      "list": [
        {
          "address": "0xb85b3d61439a3d70d3df7913a3a764f352b32c55",
          "points": 1,
          "rank": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can use cursor to paginate through the leaderboard.
