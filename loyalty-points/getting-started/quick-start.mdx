This quick start guide will walk you through deploying and interacting with your own LoyaltyPoint contract. Follow the steps below to set up your loyalty points system quickly.

# **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- **Foundry**: Install Foundry by following the instructions at https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

# **Contract Deployment**

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

> Note: Repo will be published soon.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/galxe/loyalty-point.git
cd loyalty-point
```

## **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

```bash
forge install
```

## **Step 3: Compile Contracts**

```bash
forge build
```

## **Step 4: Deploy your own LoyaltyPoint**

Set up necessary environment variables:

```bash
FACTORY_ADDRESS=<factory-address>
PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
OWNER=<owner-address>
MINTER=<minter-address>
```

- `FACTORY_ADDRESS` is the address of the deployed LoyaltyPointFactory contract on the network you are deploying to. For example, on Gravity Alpha Testnet Sepolia, the factory address is `0x8a85eC5AE1ae2c757eEfBb10b1203C984120bf8c`.
- `PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the owner address.
- `OWNER` is the owner address of the LoyaltyPoint contract.
- `MINTER` is the minter address of the LoyaltyPoint contract.

Run the deployment script:

```bash
forge script script/DeployLoyaltyPoint.s.sol:DeployLoyaltyPoint --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast
```

- `rpc-url` is the RPC URL of the network you are deploying to. For example, on Gravity Alpha Testnet Sepolia, the RPC URL is `https://rpc-sepolia.gravity.xyz`.

# **Interacting with the LoyaltyPoint Contract**

## **Mint Loyalty Points to user**

Using the `MINTER` address, you can mint loyalty points to a user:

Set up necessary environment variables:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
LOYALTY_POINT_ADDRESS=<loyalty-point-address>
USER_ADDRESS=<user-address>
```

- `PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the MINTER address.
- `LOYALTY_POINT_ADDRESS` is the address of the deployed LoyaltyPoint contract.
- `USER_ADDRESS` is the address of the user to mint points to.

Run the minting script:

```bash
forge script script/MintLoyaltyPoint.s.sol:MintLoyaltyPoint --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast
```

# **Conclusion**

You've successfully deployed your loyalty points system! The LoyaltyPoint contract provides a robust system for minting, burning, and controlling loyalty points for your users, while the factory allows for easy contract creation and management.

Continue by integrating the contracts with your frontend or dApp to offer a seamless user experience.
