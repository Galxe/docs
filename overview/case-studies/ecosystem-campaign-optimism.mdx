### **Challenge**[](#challenge "Direct link to heading")

An Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, [Optimism](http://optimism.io/) enables developers to deploy instant and scalable smart contacts at a lower cost yet higher speed. Through their pioneering “retroactive public goods funding,” Optimism is motivating Web3 entrepreneurs to produce public goods, by encouraging the building of open-source programs and paying creators based on the future usage volume of their creations.

While Layer 1 blockchains focus on building security and decentralization, L2s such as Optimism provides a solution to the “Blockchain Trilemma” and brings scalability to dApps.

“Through user feedback, we learned that our community was eager to learn about new apps on Optimism but often, they didn’t know where or how to begin.” Says Zain Bacchus, the Ecosystem Product Manager at Optimism.

To introduce their ecosystem to a larger audience and better connect with their community, Optimism was seeking an effective and sustainable way to help more consumers discover, explore apps, and meaningfully engage in the Optimism ecosystem.

### **Solution**[](#solution "Direct link to heading")

The leader in Web3 community building, Galxe has powered numerous ecosystem campaigns for Ethereum-based platforms, including [DeFi 101 NFT Campaign](https://blog.galxe.com/coingecko-introduces-defi-101-nft-campaign-on-project-galaxy-4bdae4f0f539) in collaboration with [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) and the [Arbitrum Odyssey](https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-teams-up-for-arbitrum-odyssey-104e07edcdc9). When exploring opportunities to help consumers find apps on Optimism, the team chose Galxe as the platform for their own [Optimism Quests](https://dev.optimism.io/quests/).

Throughout this 4-month learn-to-earn journey, users were invited to explore 18 different dApps built on Optimism and receive NFT rewards by competing on and off-chain tasks. The Quests were designed in a structure where all Web3 enthusiasts, no matter their level of experience and interest, could find their way to get started with introductory tasks and ease into more sophisticated ones.

On top of a learning structure with informative tutorials and quizzes, participants were provided with the opportunity to experience the dApps! Through swapping, bridging, and more on-chain interaction, users were able to claim [exclusive NFTs from all participating projects on Galxe](https://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6xiUtedg).

The overall campaign resulted in a total of 3.4 million NFTs being minted and participants were more than excited to learn about a variety of dApps and opportunities that Optimism has to offer.

### **Result**[](#result "Direct link to heading")

What was more impressive than the millions of mints was the retention rate achieved post-campaign. Comparing the 30-day pre-quest and post-quest data, [Dune](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-quests-project-usage-growth) reported that the [Optimism Quests](https://app.optimism.io/quests) brought almost a 50% increase in all Optimism usage and the number of unique wallet addresses making transactions per day doubled from 11.65k to 25.13k.

In the case of individual dApps, the highest percentage of increase in user acquisition was an incredible 276.9% for [Granary](https://granary.finance/markets), while [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/) achieved an incredible increase in 7k new users, from 15k to 22k. Overall, participating projects achieved an average growth of 23%.

> “One of the biggest barriers preventing people from exploring more apps was a lack of clarity around those applications’ use cases. By partnering with Galxe, we were able to develop and launch Optimism Quests to onboard and educate new users about some of the most popular apps in the Optimism ecosystem.” - Zain Bacchus, Ecosystem Product Manager
