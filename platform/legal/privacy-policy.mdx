The security of your Personal Information is important to us.

We also have procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach, and we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe, such as choosing a strong password and logging out of your User Account and closing your web browser when finished using the Services.

### Transfers outside the UK/Europe

For users in the UK and European Economic Area (“EEA”). We may sometimes transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the UK and EEA, for example if we are using a supplier based elsewhere. The privacy laws in countries outside the UK and EEA may be different from those in your home country.

Where we transfer data to a country that has not been deemed to provide adequate data protection standards, we will always have security measures and approved European or UK model clauses (available on the European Union’s legal website at eur-lex.europa.eu and the UK ones at the ICO website [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)) or other adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information. Please contact us if you would like more details about our safeguards for data transfers outside of the UK/EEA.

For other users. If we transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of your home country, we will take steps to comply with the requirements for such transfer in your home country as required by relevant law.

The Services provide links to various websites operated by third parties including, but not limited to, third-party sites that may display Galxe trademarks. This Policy does not apply to third-party websites that are accessible through the Services, unless such website directs users or visitors to this Policy. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of the Services and connected to the website of the organization or company that maintains that website. Even if an affiliation exists between us and a third-party website, we exercise no control over linked websites. Each of these linked websites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect, use, share, and secure your information before providing any Personal Information.

Except to the extent prohibited by law, and subject to this Policy, we will retain and use your Personal Information for as long as it is needed to provide you with any services, communications, information you have requested, or access to the Website, to document our business relationship with you, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
