Galxe API enables dynamic management of user credential data, including adding, removing, or replacing user lists in campaigns. It is designed for scenarios that require real-time updates, making it ideal for managing user access, eligibility, or participation in campaigns.

---

## Requirements

- **Access Token**: Obtain a `access-token` bound to your wallet address for authentication.
- **Permissions**: Ensure your wallet address has admin or owner access to the space where the credential resides.
- **Rate Limits**: For large request volumes, contact Galxe to whitelist your external IP and avoid rate-limit issues.

---

## Core Operations

- **APPEND**: Add new items (e.g., addresses or emails) to an existing list.
- **REMOVE**: Remove specific items from the list.
- **REPLACE**: Replace the entire list (recommended only for small data sets, e.g., less than 500 entries).

---

## Interaction Method

- API operations are performed using **GraphQL mutations**, allowing flexible and efficient data updates.
- Eligibility of users is evaluated through responses processed by JavaScript expressions, returning `1` (eligible) or `0` (not eligible).

---

## Use Cases

- **Campaign Management**: Dynamically update user data for specific campaigns.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Verify and update user credentials, such as wallet addresses or emails.
- **Batch Updates**: Modify credential lists for rewards distribution, permissions, or event participation.

## Notes

- **REPLACE Usage**: Suitable for small-scale updates; for large lists, use REMOVE followed by APPEND.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Always retry requests on errors. APPEND and REMOVE operations are idempotent and safe for repeated attempts.
- **Rate Limits**: Monitor API usage to avoid `429` errors, and contact Galxe for whitelisting if necessary.
