## Overview

GraphQL Single-Dimensional Credential allows you to fetch user data via GraphQL APIs and validate user eligibility based on a single condition. It is suitable for  when task verification is equivalent to answering the question, *Did this particular user perform this task â€” yes or no?*

<Tip>If you want to understand the workflow and considerations of GraphQL credentials, please refer to the [introduction](/quest/credential-api/graphql-cred/introduction)</Tip>

## Config process

### 1. Finding the Config in Task Settings

The option to configure GraphQL credential can be found in step 3, `Task Settings` of quest creation on the Galxe Dashboard, under the `Import Your Own Data` task type.

### 2. Basic Config

* **ID Type**

`ID Type` provides various identity options, including social accounts, blockchain addresses, and other unique identifiers.

* **Title**

Give your credential an enticing title.

* **Credential Source**

Choose `GraphQL` type

* **Type**:

Choose `Single Dimension`

### 3. Configure API

* Input Endpoint Example:

```plaintext
https://api.example.com/query
```

* Add Headers (Optional)

```json
`access-token`: `YOUR_TOKEN`
```

* Input Query:

```graphql
query info($address: String!) {
    tokenBalance(address: $address) {
    balance
    }
}
```

### 4. Test API Response

* Input a test address, send the request, and confirm whether the response is correct.

* The response must be in JSON format. Example:

```json
    {
        "balance":100
    }
```

### 5. Write Expressions

1. **Points balance validation**:

```javascript
   function(resp) {
       return resp.balance >= 100 ? 1 : 0;
   }
```

### 6. Description

Description of the certificate, supports rich text input, maximum 200 characters.

### 7. Call-to-Action Link

Guide users to specific operation pages to complete interactive tasks.

### 8. Participation End Time && Update Frequency (Optional)

* **Participation End Time**:

Control the time range of the credential, prohibiting new validations after the deadline.

* **Update Frequency**:

Remind users of the frequency of API data source updates, such as once a day or once every two days.
