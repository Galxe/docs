Galxe offers a variety of **Credential Advanced Configuration Types**, allowing you to validate and showcase user-specific information or on-chain interaction records in multiple ways:

| **Type**           | **Features**                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CSV File**       | Easy to use, suitable for small-scale data validation, requires manual upload.                           |
| **Google Sheets**  | Periodic synchronization, easy to manage, relies on Google services.                                     |
| **API**            | Supports real-time data push to Galxe.                                                                   |
| **REST**           | Supports dynamic updates, ideal for developers needing complex data structures and real-time validation. |
| **GraphQL**        | Provides flexible querying capabilities, suitable for complex interaction scenarios.                     |
| **Contract Query** | Enables contract query capabilities, commonly used to query ERC20/ERC721 holders.                        |

## CORS Check

For REST, GraphQL, and Contract Query types with custom RPCs, it is necessary to check whether the endpoints have CORS issues.

***

## Recommended Configuration Steps

1. **Select a Type**: Choose the appropriate type based on the use case (CSV, API).

2. **CORS Check(**&#x4F;ptiona&#x6C;**)**: Check for potential CORS issues for REST and GraphQL types.

3. **Upload or Integrate Data**: Upload CSV files as required or push data via API.

4. **Set Rules**: Configure validation logic (specify fields, conditions).

5. **Test and Validate**: Verify the configuration in a test quest.

6. **Publish and Monitor**: Deploy to activities and monitor real-time performance.

## Use Cases

* **On-Chain Interactions**: Validate the authenticity of users' on-chain interaction records.

* **Data-Driven Marketing**: Design marketing campaigns using custom data uploaded by users.
