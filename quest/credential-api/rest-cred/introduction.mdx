`REST` Credentials support integration with any available `REST` endpoints and send requests during user verification for interaction.

The `REST` Credential is a method used by Galxe to pull data from your `RESTful HTTPS` backend (or any legally accessible `HTTP RESTful` endpoint). It takes a single wallet address as input and outputs `1` (eligible) or `0` (not eligible) to determine whether the wallet address qualifies.

### **Workflow**
<img height="200" src="../../../images/cred/cred-rest-workflow.png" />
1. **app.galxe.com**: When a user clicks "Verify" on the Quest page, Galxe sends the user's wallet address or other social media information as an input parameter.
2. **Galxe Backend**: Based on the pre-configuration, Galxe sends an HTTP request containing the wallet address to your `REST API` and waits for the response.
3. **Your Backend**: After receiving the HTTP request from Galxe, your backend processes the request and returns the response data related to the wallet address.
4. **Galxe Backend**: Processes the `response.body` from your backend using predefined expressions to determine if the user meets the conditions.
<Note>`35.185.209.0` and `35.203.155.18` are our outbound IPs. Failure to whitelist these may result in 403 errors when accessing the service.</Note>

### **Configuration Requirements**

**API Specification**

- **Endpoint**:  
  The URL of the `REST` endpoint.

<Note>We only support the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS (80 and 443).</Note>

- **(Optional) Headers**:
  `Key-value` pairs included in the `REST` request.

**Parameter Mapping (Placeholders)**

- `$address`: Replaced with the user's wallet address as a hexadecimal string with the `0x` prefix, e.g., **`0x95ad73...`**.
- `$addressWithout0x`: Replaced with the user's wallet address as a hexadecimal string without the `0x` prefix, e.g., **`95ad73...`**, typically used for constructing **`eth_call`** requests.
- `$value`: Used when user information is not an address (email or Telegram ID) and replaced with the respective information.

<Warning>For addresses encoded in case-insensitive formats (EVM or Aptos addresses starting with `0x`), Galxe converts them to lowercase before sending to your endpoint.</Warning>

---

### **Data Format**

Galxe supports **JSON body format** exclusively for both `GET` and `POST` responses.

```json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

<Warning>Galxe requires requests to respond within 5 seconds; otherwise, the request will be canceled.</Warning>

### **Expression**

**Function Requirements**

1. Write an anonymous `JavaScript (ES6)` function with the type signature `(object) => int`.
2. The function takes the entire response object `resp` as a parameter.
3. It must return the number `1` or `0`, indicating whether the address qualifies for the credential.
<Warning>
Do not return Boolean values (`true/false`) or strings (`"0"/"1"`).
</Warning>

**Anonymous Function Format**

The function must be `anonymous`, with the first line written in the following format:

```javascript
function(resp) {
  /* Function body */
}
```
<Tip>To ensure a more secure `function`, always validate the structure of the `resp` object before accessing its properties,
this helps prevent errors or unexpected behavior when the API response is incomplete or incorrectly formatted.</Tip>


### **Security and Authorization**
When configuring the `REST API`, you can achieve secure access through request headers (such as `API KEY` or `tokens`). This information will not be exposed by Galxe, and only users with Space admin privileges can view it.
<Warning>You should still be careful not to embed other private information in the expression encoding, as this will be made public.</Warning>

### **CORS**

Galxe's API calls are not made through the browser but via backend servers. Although this avoids triggering browser CORS restrictions, we still send preflight `OPTIONS` requests during API configuration to validate the API's correctness. This process does not adhere to the [Simple Request Convention](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests).
