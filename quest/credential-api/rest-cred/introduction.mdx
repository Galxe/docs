### **Overview**

Galxe REST Credentials support integration with any available REST API endpoints and send requests during user verification for interaction.

The REST Credential is a method used by Galxe to pull data from your RESTful HTTPS backend (or any legally accessible HTTP RESTful endpoint). It takes a single wallet address as input and outputs `1` (eligible) or `0` (not eligible) to determine whether the wallet address qualifies.

### **Workflow**

1. **app.galxe.com**: When a user clicks "Verify" on the Quest page, Galxe sends the user's wallet address or other social media information as an input parameter.
2. **Galxe Backend**: Based on the pre-configuration, Galxe sends an HTTP request containing the wallet address to your REST API and waits for the response.
3. **Your Backend**: After receiving the HTTP request from Galxe, your backend processes the request and returns the response data related to the wallet address.
4. **Galxe Backend**: Processes the `response.body` from your backend using predefined expressions to determine if the user meets the conditions.
<Note>For Multi-type, the eligibility is determined based on the rules configured in the Quest, not just the expression output (1/0).</Note>

### **Requirements for Configuring Galxe Credential with REST API**

**API Specification**

- **Endpoint**:  
  The URL of the REST API endpoint.

- **(Optional) Headers**:  
  Key-value pairs included in the REST API request.

**Parameter Mapping (Placeholders)**

- `$address`: Replaced with the user's wallet address as a hexadecimal string with the `0x` prefix, e.g., **`0x95ad73...`**.
- `$addressWithout0x`: Replaced with the user's wallet address as a hexadecimal string without the `0x` prefix, e.g., **`95ad73...`**, typically used for constructing **`eth_call`** requests.
- `$value`: Used when user information is not an address (e.g., email or Telegram ID) and replaced with the respective information.
<Warning>For addresses encoded in case-insensitive formats (e.g., EVM or Aptos addresses starting with `0x`), Galxe converts them to lowercase before sending to your endpoint.</Warning>

---

### **Data Format**

Galxe supports **JSON body format** exclusively for both `GET` and `POST` responses.

```json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

<Warning>Galxe requires requests to respond within 5 seconds; otherwise, the request will be canceled.</Warning>

### **Expression**

**Function Requirements**

1. Write an anonymous JavaScript (ES6) function with the type signature `(object) => int`.
2. The function takes the entire response object `resp` as a parameter.
3. It must return the number `1` or `0`, indicating whether the address qualifies for the credential.
<Warning>
Do not return Boolean values (`true/false`) or strings (`"0"/"1"`).
</Warning>

**Anonymous Function Format**

The function must be anonymous, with the first line written in the following format:

```javascript
function(resp) {
  /* Function body */
}
