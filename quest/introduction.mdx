## What is Galxe?[](#what-is-galxe "Direct link to heading")

At Galxe, we are building the infrastructure to power an open and collaborative credential data network. We help Web3 developers leverage credential data to build better products and communities. At the same time, data curators contribute to our credential data network while earning income once the data is utilized. You can learn more about Galxe at our [website](http://galxe.com) and this [deep dive](https://blog.galxe.com/deep-dive-into-project-galaxy-abd33eceb19b) article.

In the summer of 2023, we released a new product called [Galxe protocol](https://app.galxe.com/protocol). Based on zero-knowledge proof technologies, the protocol brings a self-sovereign identity service to Galxe ecosystem. We will update more docs later. For now you can read our whitepaper [here](https://github.com/Galxe/protocol-whitepaper).

NFTs created on Galxe can be used as keys for holders to unlock gated chat channels on Discord and Telegram via Collab Land bot.

## Snapshot: Voting w/ NFTs[](#snapshot-voting-w-nfts "Direct link to heading")

Design a customized governance strategy for your community/DAO by allowing users to vote with NFTs. With the native voting strategy on Snapshot.org created by Galxe team, community admins can create strategies and assign special voting power to different NFTs based on their attributes/campaigns on Galxe.
